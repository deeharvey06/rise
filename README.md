## Welcome to the Rise Developer Challenge!

### The coding challenge

Your goal is to implement one of Rise's interactive blocks (see [this Rise course](https://rise.articulate.com/share/QNNxptM9l1O6nA-l3BNQdOO-_6dW8prV) for more details).

At a minimum, your implementation should:
1. populate your interactive block's configuration from the provided REST API (see [`/server`](/server))
1. use `react` for your UI components
1. persist your interactive block's UI state by extending the provided REST API

What you choose to implement from there is up to you. :)

### Implementation notes:

- your interactive block implementation should live in the [`/client`](/client) directory and have its own `package.json`, `node_modules`, etc.
- feel free to bootstrap your solution with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (or whatever tools you prefer)
- the beginnings of a REST API lives in [`/server`](/server) and is reachable at http://localhost:5000
  - the REST API currently uses variables as a makeshift in-memory database

### Getting started

To get the client up and running on your dev machine:

1. `cd client`
1. `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
1. `yarn start` (or `npm start`)


To get the REST API up and running on your dev machine:

1. `cd server`
1. `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
1. `yarn start` (or `npm start`)
